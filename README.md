# BachelorThesis
In this repository it is possible to find the code I wrote for my bachelor thesis titled "Simulation of the internal calibrator of the LSPE/Strip instrument".

In particular, three files are available: 
    
(a) "intervals_fixedobst" used to perform the intervals analysis with fixed observation times exposed in section 3.5.1 in my thesis;
    
(b) "intervals_fixedont" used to perform the intervals analysis with fixed number of periods exposed in section 3.5.2 in my thesis;
    
(c) "ignitions" used to perform the ignitions analysis exposed in section 3.6 in my thesis.

I wrote the code in the programming language Julia and I used the pipeline Stripeline.jl (see https://lspestrip.github.io/Stripeline.jl/latest/ for the documentation) to simulate the motion of the Strip telescope. The files are in the format of Jupyter Notebooks.
